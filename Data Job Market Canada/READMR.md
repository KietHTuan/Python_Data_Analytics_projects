# Canadian Data Job Market Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores key insights into the Canadian job market for data professionals, with a focus on roles such as Data Analysts, Business Analysts, and Insights Analysts. The project highlights the critical process of **cleaning and manipulating messy data** using Python. Key objectives include:

- Industries hiring the most Data Analysts
- Common skills required for these roles
- Base salary expectations by experience level
- Company size and hiring trends
- The importance of degrees in the hiring process
- Work environment and job types
- Top hiring locations across Canada

## About the Data
The dataset was collected via web scraping from LinkedIn using the **Magical AI-powered Chrome extension**. Due to time constraints, the dataset includes 60 job listings. The raw data was **inconsistent and messy**, requiring **significant cleaning** and transformation before meaningful **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** could be performed.

### Data Challenges:
- **Inconsistent format**: The data was highly unstructured with missing values, inconsistent job titles, and irregular salary formats.
- **Data Cleaning Focus**: The cleaning process included handling missing data, standardizing job titles, normalizing salary ranges, and parsing job descriptions for relevant skills.
- **Messy Data**: The original dataset required extensive preprocessing due to its **very ugly, messy format** before any insights could be derived.

### Key Steps in Data Cleaning:
- Handling **missing values** across job listings.
- **Normalizing salary ranges** to extract meaningful insights.
- Standardizing **job titles** and parsing job descriptions to identify required skills.
- Cleaning and consolidating inconsistent formats across columns.
  
## Deliverables
1. **Python Jupyter Notebook**: Data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory analysis.
2. **Tableau Dashboard**: Share the key insights visually for easier understanding and decision-making.
