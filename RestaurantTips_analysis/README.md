# Restaurant Tips Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze tipping patterns at a restaurant to gain insights into customer behavior, service quality, and overall restaurant operations. The analysis is based on real-life data provided by my former employer.

## Objectives
- Determine the **average tip amount** and **tip percentage per bill**.
- Investigate whether **weekend tips** are higher than weekday tips.
- Identify which **hour of the day** receives the highest tip amount per bill.
- Determine which **day of the week** receives the highest tip amount per bill.
- Analyze whether the **evening shift** receives higher tips than the morning shift.
- Explore the **correlation** between **tip amount** and **total bill**.

## Business Impact
- **Enhanced Customer Experience**: Understanding tipping patterns helps optimize service during peak times, improving customer satisfaction.
- **Inventory Preparation**: High tips per bill may indicate larger family tables, helping staff prepare accordingly.

## Deliverables
- **Python Jupyter Notebook** with exploratory data analysis and visualizations.
- **Tableau Dashboard** with summarized insights ([Dashboard link](https://public.tableau.com/views/Restauranttipsanalysis/Descriptive_data)).

## About the Data
- Data is sampled from archived restaurant receipts with confidential information removed.
- **Data collection process**: Random sampling of receipts for each day, ensuring a representative range of hours.
- **Data assumptions**:
  - Sample size may not be large enough to precisely identify patterns.
  - Data excludes tips by cash and app-based to-go orders.
  - Data does not cover every month of the year.
